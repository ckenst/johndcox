# John D. Cox

Website for my uncle, the author, John D. Cox. 

Found this biography for him:

weather, climate and the environment. He has written extensively about such climate
events as El Niño and such hotly debated climate issues as global warming.

> John is the author of the acclaimed ready-reference Weather For Dummies published
in 2000, Storm Watchers, a popular history of meteorology published in 2002 by John
Wiley & Sons Inc., and most recently, in 2005 by Joseph Henry Press, Climate Crash:
Abrupt Climate Change and What it Means For Our Future.

> A member of the National Association of Science Writers, he was a 1995-’96 Knight
Science Journalism Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

> He has worked for many years as a daily journalist in several bureaus in the western U.S.
for United Press International, in London as an editor of the western hemisphere service
of Reuters Limited, and in California as a senior writer for The Sacramento Bee.
