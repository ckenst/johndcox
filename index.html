                    or decades, my uncle covered science stories as a journalist. The latter part of his career was focused on weather, climate and the environment. He wrote extensively about such climate events as El Niño and such hotly debated climate issues as global warming.
                    
                    <p>John was the author of the acclaimed ready-reference Weather For Dummies published in 2000 & again in 2021, Storm Watchers, a popular history of meteorology published in 2002 by John Wiley & Sons Inc., and in 2005 by Joseph Henry Press, Climate Crash: Abrupt Climate Change and What it Means For Our Future.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>He was a member of the National Association of Science Writers. He was a 1995-’96 Knight Science Journalism Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

                    John worked for many years as a daily journalist in several bureaus in the western U.S. for United Press International, in London as an editor of the western hemisphere service of Reuters Limited, and in California as a senior writer for The Sacramento Bee.
                    He served on the staff of the late John Burton, then California State Assembly member. He was later a speech writer for state legistrative democrats. 

                    <p>He will be missed.</p>
